# CS_260_StartUpApp
This is a semester-long course project for CS 260 (Web Design). 
I am very excited to learn!

## Notes: 
My vision for this project is the best organization tool. This tool will feature a priority system where you can set your priorities, list out upcoming tasks, events, and reminders and assign them each to different priority categories. These can then be automatically added to your calendar according to the priorities you have set for your different categories. For example, I could set my priorities as: 
    1. Skiing 
    2. Family 
    3. Work 
    4. School 
Then, as I add upcoming events, tasks, and reminders I could assign them to one of my priority categories. Then, I could add them to my calendar all at once. The application could do this automatically in order of the priorities of their categories. 

### GitHub Assignment
- In order to avoid git merges, pull and push often. 
- Backup often and use branches so all of your work is safe.
